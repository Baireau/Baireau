# About Me

Hey there! 👋 I’m a cybersecurity geek with a passion for reverse engineering, especially in the realms of **pwn** and **hardware** 🛠️. I love diving deep into code and figuring out how things tick!

As a proud **Linux** 🐧 evangelist, I’m all about that open-source life. Right now, I’m grinding through **C** 💻 on my own to level up my skills. Once I’ve mastered C, I’ll be diving into **Rust** 🦀—coming soon!

I’m always on the lookout for new challenges and opportunities to learn. If you’re into cybersecurity, reverse engineering, or just want to chat about the latest exploits, hit me up! Let’s connect and share some knowledge in this ever-evolving digital landscape.
